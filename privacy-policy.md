Privacy Policy â€“ AI Clipper

AI Clipper respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it.

Information Collection

This extension does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email, address, or phone number.
The extension only processes website content (such as text, images, or links) that you explicitly choose to clip.

Data Usage

The collected content is used only to perform the clipping functionality.

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

No browsing history, location, or personal data is tracked or stored.

Permissions

The requested permissions (storage, tabs, contextMenus, scripting, identity) are only used for the extensionâ€™s core functionality and not for tracking or advertising purposes.

AI Tagging (Testing Notice)

Currently, all AI tags are generated using placeholder (fake) logic for testing purposes.
In future versions, when an original API is integrated, it will only process the text highlighted by the user and return suggested tags.
No authentication credentials, browsing history, or personal data will ever be stored or misused.

Security

Any data sent to AI services is transmitted securely and used only for generating results.
We do not permanently store or log your clipped data.
